# Product Guidelines: Chakra Energy

## Visual Standards
- **Authentic Imagery:** All existing chakra images and symbols must be preserved exactly as designed. They are purposeful and sacred to the meditation experience.
- **Mindful Animation:** Use subtle CSS pulsing and scaling animations (e.g., matching a breathing rhythm) to create an "alive" feel for the symbols without modifying the source images.
- **Immersive Color Palette:** Backgrounds and UI elements should subtly shift to the primary color of the active chakra (e.g., deep red for Root, indigo for Third Eye) during the session to create a focused atmosphere.

## Auditory Standards
- **Voice Synthesis (Text-to-Speech):**
    - **Tone:** Calm, soothing, and ethereal.
    - **Pacing:** Slow and intentional, allowing for the spiritual weight of the words (Mantra, Location, Power, etc.) to resonate.
- **Vibrational Music:** Each chakra's specific meditation music (Lam.aac, Yam.aac, etc.) must be clear and loop seamlessly during the active timer.
- **The "Wake Up" Bell:** A crisp, singular temple bell sound signals the completion of a timer, acting as a gentle transition point.

## Interaction & Flow
- **The Serialized Session:**
    1. **Guidance Phase:** The app reads aloud the Name, Mantra, Location, Power, Element, and Description directly from the chakra card.
    2. **Mindful Transition:** A 2-3 second pause follows the last word of guidance.
    3. **Meditation Phase:** The meditation music begins and the timer starts automatically.
    4. **Sequential Advance:** After the bell rings, the app automatically moves to the next chakra in the sequence without user intervention.
